# Random-User-Generator


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks to visit my Github! In this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project created with flexbox. I used "Random User Generator API". To get data from API, I used fecth method with async-await. 
**To do this project, i used HTML5, CSS(SCSS) and JavaScript.I used async-await to fetch data.**

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
