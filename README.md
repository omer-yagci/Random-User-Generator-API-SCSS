# Pokedex-with-SASS-SCSS


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks to visit my Github! In this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project created with flexbox. I used "Pokedex API". To get data from api, i used fecth method with async-await. For search bar, i checked all poke names if matches or not. 

**To do this project, i used HTML5, CSS(SCSS) and JavaScript.I used async-await to fetch data.**
